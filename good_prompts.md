**Prompt:**

> lets change the flow of the game setup screen. lets first show two teams from the jump. when i click on a suggested name it should automatically be rmoved and placed into the first team. then the second into the first team. then the third into the second team and so on. when the first two teams are full the a third teams appers. this means we remove the create teams button and dialog completely

**Problem:**

The original game setup screen required users to manually create teams after adding players, using a separate dialog and button. The new flow should automatically assign players to teams as they are added, always showing at least two teams, and dynamically adding more teams as needed. This streamlines the process and removes unnecessary steps for the user.
